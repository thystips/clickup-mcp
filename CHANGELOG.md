## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Custom fields can now be read and written through the MCP.** A new `getListCustomFields` tool lists a list's custom fields with their ids, types, valid options and whether they are writable (ClickUp-computed `automatic_progress`/`formula`/`rollup` fields and `attachment` fields are flagged as read-only/unsupported). `createTask` and `updateTask` accept an optional `custom_fields: [{ name, value }]` array. Field references are matched by name first (emoji, case, accents and extra spaces are ignored, letters and digits from any script are kept, and a unique partial name also matches, e.g. `domain` resolves `🧩 Domain`), falling back to the exact field id. Values are resolved per type: `drop_down`/`labels` take an option name or id, `users` take a user id, email or exact username (or an `{ add, rem }` diff), `checkbox` takes true/false, `date` takes an ISO string or epoch ms, `number`/`currency`/`rating` take a number, `tasks` take task ids (or an `{ add, rem }` diff), and text types take a string; `null` clears a field. On create the resolved fields travel in the task body; on update each field is written through `POST /task/{id}/field/{field_id}` so a single failure does not roll back the others. All fields are resolved before anything is written, so an unknown field or option aborts with the task untouched.
- `getTaskById` now renders `users` and `labels` custom fields by name (previously users printed as `[object Object]`) and `date` fields as an ISO timestamp instead of the raw epoch value.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **`updateTask` can replace a task description** ([#37](https://github.com/hauptsacheNet/clickup-mcp/pull/37)). The new `description` parameter overwrites the whole description, like `updateDocumentPage` does for doc pages; `append_description` keeps adding a dated `**Edit (YYYY-MM-DD):**` section below the existing text. Passing both is rejected before anything is touched. Rewriting a description (restructuring, shortening, removing an obsolete point) previously produced a duplicate below the old text, and the only way out was a different MCP server. ClickUp now keeps a [task description history](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6309673287575-Task-description-history) on every plan, so a bad replacement can be restored in the UI (verified: each replacement shows up as its own version with a diff view, but edits by the same user within the same minute are merged into one version) - the tool description tells the model to read the current text first and carry over what is still needed. Images in a replacing description go through the same upload pipeline as before. The response says whether the description was replaced (with old/new length) or appended.

### Fixed
- **Comments written via `addComment`/`editComment` lost their paragraph breaks.** ClickUp has no paragraph margins: the UI stores a paragraph break as an extra empty `\n` fragment (what pressing Enter twice produces), but the markdown converter emitted only a single `\n` between paragraphs, so consecutive paragraphs rendered as one block of lines and a paragraph following a list was glued to the last bullet. `convertMarkdownToClickUpBlocks` now inserts an empty line between adjacent flow blocks (paragraph/list). Headings, code blocks and blockquotes bring their own spacing in ClickUp and get no extra blank line, so they do not double up. Hard line breaks (`  \n`) still map to a single newline.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- **`getTaskById` renders task dependencies and linked tasks** ([#31](https://github.com/hauptsacheNet/clickup-mcp/pull/31)). The task payload already carries a flat `dependencies` array covering both directions plus `linked_tasks`, but none of it was rendered - a dependency written via `updateTask` could not be verified through the MCP at all. The metadata block now shows `waiting_on:`, `blocking:` and `linked_tasks:` lines (only when non-empty), with the direction derived from which side of each pair the task sits on.
- **Threaded comment replies in `getTaskById`** ([#34](https://github.com/hauptsacheNet/clickup-mcp/issues/34)). `GET /task/{id}/comment` only returns top-level comments, so replies inside a thread (Threaded Comments ClickApp) were missing entirely - without any hint that a thread existed. For every comment with `reply_count > 0` the replies are now fetched via `GET /comment/{id}/reply` and rendered nested under their parent comment, oldest first. Comments without a thread cost no extra request; reply fetches are bounded (at most 30 threads per read, 5 requests at a time) to stay within the 100 calls/minute budget, and a thread whose replies could not be loaded says so instead of rendering as threadless.
- **`addComment` can reply inside a thread.** A new optional `parent_comment_id` parameter posts the comment via `POST /comment/{parent_comment_id}/reply` instead of creating a new top-level comment. The id is validated to be a top-level comment of the given task before anything is uploaded or posted - the reply endpoint anchors the reply to the parent's task, so a mismatched id would otherwise post to the wrong task while images land on `task_id`.
- `getTaskById` now renders each top-level comment's `comment_id` in its header, so `editComment` and `addComment`'s `parent_comment_id` can actually be used with ids "as returned by getTaskById" - previously the ids were not part of the output at all.

### Fixed
- **`updateTask` could never remove a task link** ([#33](https://github.com/hauptsacheNet/clickup-mcp/pull/33)). The `linked_tasks` parameter is documented as replacing the existing links, but the removal half read a non-existent `.id` off the link records (they carry `task_id`/`link_id`, the two ends of the link). Every removal became `DELETE /task/{id}/link/undefined`, surfacing as `Failed to remove link: undefined` in `dependency_warnings` while the link stayed. Links are now identified by whichever end of the record is not the task being updated, so links created from either side are removed correctly. Note: `blocking`/`waiting_on` have a related read bug (`taskData.blocking`/`waiting_on` are never returned by the API) and still cannot remove dependencies - left for a follow-up.
- **`getTaskById` silently truncated comment histories to the 25 newest comments.** The `?start_date=0` parameter it passed is ignored by ClickUp (there is no such parameter). Comments are now paged with `start`/`start_id` like `editComment` already did, up to 10 pages (250 comments); hitting that cap is logged instead of staying silent.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **Task IDs longer than 9 characters were rejected before a request was ever made.** ClickUp lengthened its generated task IDs in August 2026 without announcing it or documenting a format: IDs created up to 5 August are 9 characters (`86eyhry52`), from 12 August 10 characters (`z8nrz7c744`), and by the end of August already 11 (`123yxuagf4a`). Every tool taking a `task_id` - `getTaskById`, `addComment`, `editComment`, `updateTask`, `getTimeEntries`, `createTimeEntry` - failed schema validation with `String must contain at most 9 character(s)`, so a task could be created through the server and then never touched again. The bound is now 6-16 characters everywhere (thanks @zebdro).
- **Task URLs in comments stopped rendering as live task references for long IDs.** The URL pattern behind the `task_mention` conversion carried its own 6-12 bound, which would silently fall back to a plain link once IDs grew past 12 characters. It now uses the same 6-16 bound as the rest of the validation.

### Notes
- The upper bound is deliberately kept rather than removed: it is what rejects URLs and `CU-` prefixed strings before they cost an API call. 16 is not a documented ClickUp limit - none exists, the API reference types `task_id` as a plain string - but leaves headroom for a format that grew twice within a month.
- Widening `isTaskId` slightly increases false positives in `searchTasks`, where an 11-to-16-character alphanumeric search term is now treated as a candidate task ID. The cost is a wasted lookup, not a wrong result.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **`editComment` tool** - replaces the text of an existing task comment instead of forcing a follow-up comment when something in a just-posted comment turns out to be wrong. Formatting and images survive the edit, because ClickUp's `PUT /comment/{id}` accepts the same rich fragment array as comment creation (undocumented - the API reference only lists `comment_text`, which would flatten the comment to plain text). Images are resolved and uploaded before the edit, so a broken image reference leaves the existing comment untouched.
- Two guardrails, since ClickUp cannot distinguish a comment written through this MCP from one written by the same user in the web UI:
  - only comments belonging to the API token's own user can be edited, so other people's comments are safe
  - only comments created within `CLICKUP_COMMENT_EDIT_WINDOW_HOURS` (default 24) can be edited. Editing does not change the creation date, so the window cannot be extended by repeated edits.
- New `CLICKUP_COMMENT_EDIT_WINDOW_HOURS` environment variable (default 24, `0` disables `editComment`). An unparsable value fails at startup instead of silently widening or disabling the window.
- **`CLICKUP_COMMENT_EDIT_WINDOW_HOURS` and `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` are now settable from the MCPB installer UI** instead of being reachable only by hand-editing the server env. Both are optional number fields with the same defaults as before, so an existing installation keeps behaving identically. An unset optional field can reach the server blank or as an unsubstituted `${user_config.x}` placeholder; both are now treated as "not configured". `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` is also validated the same way as the edit window - it previously turned a typo into `NaN`, which compares false against every size and so lifted the upload limit instead of enforcing it.
- **Task URLs in comments become live task references.** A ClickUp task URL in `addComment`/`editComment` markdown (bare or as a link) is converted to a real `task_mention` fragment, rendering as the same chip with live task name, status and assignee that the ClickUp UI creates - instead of a plain blue link. Custom link text on a task URL is replaced by the live task name; URLs with a query or fragment (e.g. `?comment=` deep links) and custom task IDs stay ordinary links. Reading a comment returns mentions as task URLs, so the `editComment` round trip preserves them. Task *descriptions* keep rendering task URLs as plain links - the public API's `markdown_description` cannot express mention chips (verified empirically: ClickUp neither converts URLs server-side nor re-hydrates its own flattened mention export).

### Changed
- **Images are now read back as markdown.** `getTaskById` used to render an image inside a comment or description as `Image: name - url`, which is not something the write tools understand. It is now `![name](url)`, the same syntax `addComment`/`editComment`/`createTask`/`updateTask` accept. This closes the read-edit round trip: a comment read from a task can be handed back to `editComment` unchanged and keeps its images, because an existing ClickUp attachment URL is re-embedded instead of re-uploaded.

### Fixed
- **`createTask` silently dropped its `tags`.** Tags are deliberately kept out of the task request body because ClickUp applies them through dedicated endpoints, and `updateTask` did so via `POST/DELETE /task/{id}/tag/{tagName}` - but `createTask` never followed through, so a create call with `tags` produced an untagged task. The loss was easy to miss because the response echoes the call inputs rather than the stored task, and therefore listed the tags anyway. Tags are now applied right after the task exists, with failures surfaced on the same `tag_warnings:` line `updateTask` already uses (thanks @ThiagoMafra-Integrare).
- Documented that a broken image reference aborts the write - the README still described the pre-1.7.1 behaviour of writing the comment or task anyway.
- **Markdown tables in comments were silently swallowed.** ClickUp comments cannot render tables at all (verified empirically - even a hand-crafted table attribute is stored but renders as plain text), and the converter dropped table content entirely: not even the cell text reached the comment. Tables are now re-rendered as column-aligned pipe tables inside a code block, so the information survives and stays readable in monospace. Reading such a comment returns the fenced pipe table, which converts back to the same code block on edit. The `addComment`/`editComment` tool descriptions now state that tables are unsupported and suggest lists instead.
- **`~~strikethrough~~` lost its formatting.** ClickUp supports a `strike` attribute in comments, but the converter did not map GFM strikethrough to it, keeping only the plain text. Now mapped in both directions: writing `~~text~~` renders struck-through, and reading a struck-through comment returns `~~text~~`.
- **Multi-line code blocks rendered only their last line as code.** ClickUp's Quill-based comment format applies block attributes per line, so every code line needs its own `\n` fragment carrying the `code-block` attribute - a single fragment with embedded newlines degraded all but the last line to plain text. Reading was equally wrong and wrapped every code line in its own ``` fence; consecutive code lines are now merged back into one fenced block.
- Unknown block-level markdown nodes now fall back to emitting their text content instead of being dropped silently.

### Notes
- ClickUp shows no "edited" marker on a changed comment and exposes none via the API, so readers who already saw the original will not notice the change. The tool description tells the model to prefer a follow-up comment once a discussion has started.
- Replies inside a comment thread live behind a different endpoint and cannot be edited; `editComment` reports this instead of failing silently.
- `GET /task/{id}/comment` returns only the 25 newest comments per page (`start_date` is not a real parameter and is ignored). `editComment` pages back with `start`/`start_id` and stops as soon as a page ends outside the edit window, so a busy ticket still costs a single request in the normal case.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- **Image failures now abort the write instead of degrading it.** A broken image reference (missing file, dead URL, file that is not a real image, oversized upload) makes `addComment`, `createTask` and `updateTask` fail with a per-image error report *before* anything is written - no comment is posted, no task is created or modified. The caller can fix the markdown and retry without creating duplicates. Previously the write went through anyway with the image replaced by its caption and only a WARNING in the response (and before 1.7.0, images were silently dropped with no trace at all).
- `createTask` resolves and validates all description images before creating the task. Only an upload API failure after creation is reported as a WARNING, since the task already exists at that point.
- When an upload fails halfway through a batch, the error lists the images that were already uploaded with their CDN URLs, so a retry can reference those URLs directly instead of uploading them again.

### Added
- Tests for the failure paths: missing local file, non-image file, unreachable http(s) URL, upload API error with partial success, and abort behaviour of all three write tools.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Inline image upload** - `![caption](path)` in `addComment`, `createTask` and `updateTask` now uploads the image and embeds it in the ticket.
  Accepted sources: local file paths, `data:` URIs, http(s) URLs, and existing ClickUp attachment URLs (reused without re-uploading).
  Because the server runs locally, a screenshot can be referenced by path instead of being inlined as base64, which costs orders of magnitude fewer tokens.
  The caption becomes the attachment filename, which is what ClickUp displays beneath the image.
  Only real PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP files are uploaded (verified via magic bytes); a failing image is reported in the response instead of aborting the write.
- New `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` environment variable (default 10) to cap the size of a single uploaded image
- New `npm run smoke` protocol smoke test that drives the built server over real MCP stdio (initialize, tools/list, tool schemas) and optionally posts a comment with an image. `npm run cli` calls tool callbacks directly and never covered this layer.
- Added comparison table in README showing differences between this MCP and the official ClickUp MCP

### Fixed
- Fixed image MIME type detection by inspecting binary magic bytes instead of trusting HTTP headers or fallback values
- Images in comments are no longer silently dropped - `![](...)` previously vanished without a warning because mdast image nodes were not handled
- Fixed the CLI discarding any multi-line parameter value (the `key=value` pattern did not match across newlines), which made markdown impossible to test via `npm run cli`
- Fixed the test suite never reaching its mocks: `undici`'s `MockAgent` cannot intercept Node's built-in global `fetch`, so every test made real network calls and failed on DNS. 17 of 31 tests were failing before this fix

## [1.6.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- **Full markdown support for comments** - `addComment` now converts markdown to ClickUp's rich text format
- Comments now preserve formatting when reading back from ClickUp, including nested formatting

## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-02

### Changed
- The space resource now has a `ClickUp Space` suffix in the title.
- Add additional hints to all tools to potentially improve client handling.

### Added
- Added Icon to the manifest.json file.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-01

### Breaking Changes
- Replaced `writeDocument` tool with two focused tools for better clarity:
  - `updateDocumentPage`: Updates existing pages (requires doc_id and page_id)
  - `createDocumentOrPage`: Creates new documents or pages (uses space_id/list_id/doc_id)
- This change makes parameter requirements clearer and eliminates the confusion between creating and updating operations

### Fixed
- Fixed "my-todos" prompt failing with "Failed to get prompt" error in Claude Desktop by adding `prompts_generated: true` to manifest.json to declare runtime-generated prompts
- Fixed critical bug in document page updates: now uses correct ClickUp API v3 endpoint (`/workspaces/{teamId}/docs/{docId}/pages/{pageId}`) instead of incorrect endpoint that was causing 404 errors
- Fixed empty response handling in `updateDocumentPage` - now gracefully handles ClickUp API responses that don't return JSON body

### Removed
- Removed `searchDocuments` tool as it only searched document names/spaces, not content, which confused LLMs that are trained on fulltext searches. Documents can still be discovered via `searchSpaces` (which includes documents in space tree) or by direct URL.

### Changed
- Removed time entries from `searchTasks` results to improve reliability and prevent rate limit issues. Time entries are still available via `getTaskById` for individual tasks.
- Updated `readDocument` to reference new tool names (`updateDocumentPage` and `createDocumentOrPage`) in its suggestions
