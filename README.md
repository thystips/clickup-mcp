## Installation

### Prerequisites

For all installation methods, you'll need:
- Your `CLICKUP_API_KEY` (Profile Icon > Settings > Apps > API Token ~ usually starts with pk_)
- Your `CLICKUP_TEAM_ID` (The 7–10 digit number in the URL when you are in the settings)

### Option 1: MCPB Bundle (Recommended for Claude Desktop)

Download the pre-built bundle from our [releases page](https://github.com/hauptsacheNet/clickup-mcp/releases). This method requires no Node.js installation.

You'll get a configuration screen where you are prompted to enter your API key and team ID.

### Option 2: NPX Installation

This method automatically updates to the latest version and is preferred for users who want the newest features.

**For Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor and others:**

Add the following to your MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clickup": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@hauptsache.net/clickup-mcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CLICKUP_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "CLICKUP_TEAM_ID": "your_team_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your_api_key` and `your_team_id` with your actual ClickUp credentials.

**Where to add this configuration:**
- **Claude Desktop**: Settings > Developer > Edit Config
- **Windsurf**: Add to your MCP configuration file
- **Cursor**: Configure through the MCP settings panel

### Option 3: Coding Tools Integration

**Claude Code (CLI):**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user clickup \
  --env CLICKUP_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  --env CLICKUP_TEAM_ID=YOUR_ID \
  --env CLICKUP_MCP_MODE=read-minimal \
  --env MAX_IMAGES=16 \
  --env MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_MB=4 \
  -- npx -y @hauptsache.net/clickup-mcp
```

> Claude Code can handle a lot of images, thus the recommended increased limits.
 
> Note the `CLICKUP_MCP_MODE=read-minimal`. This is my usage recommendation, but feel free to use one of the other modes.

**OpenAI Codex:**
Add these lines to your `~/.codex/config.toml` file:
```toml
[mcp_servers.clickup]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@hauptsache.net/clickup-mcp@latest"]
env = { "CLICKUP_API_KEY" = "YOUR_KEY", "CLICKUP_TEAM_ID" = "YOUR_ID", "CLICKUP_MCP_MODE" = "read-minimal" }
```

> Codex seems to not be able to handle images from MCP's. See [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/3741) for more details.

> Note the `CLICKUP_MCP_MODE=read-minimal`. This is my usage recommendation, but feel free to use one of the other modes.

### Setting the Mode

Add the mode to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clickup": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hauptsache.net/clickup-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CLICKUP_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "CLICKUP_TEAM_ID": "your_team_id",
        "CLICKUP_MCP_MODE": "read"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

This MCP server can be configured using environment variables. In the desktop extension (`.mcpb`) installer, the API key, team ID, primary language, upload size limit and comment edit window are offered as form fields; the remaining variables have to be set on the server environment directly.

- `CLICKUP_API_KEY`: (Required) Your ClickUp API key.
- `CLICKUP_TEAM_ID`: (Required) Your ClickUp Team ID (formerly Workspace ID).
- `CLICKUP_MCP_MODE`: (Optional) Controls which tools are available. Options: `read-minimal`, `read`, `write` (default).
- `MAX_IMAGES`: (Optional) The maximum number of images to return for a task in `getTaskById`. Defaults to 4.
- `MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_MB`: (Optional) The maximum response size in megabytes for `getTaskById`. Uses intelligent size budgeting to fit the most important images within the limit. Defaults to 1.
- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`: (Optional) The maximum size of a single image uploaded when writing comments or descriptions. Defaults to 10.
- `CLICKUP_COMMENT_EDIT_WINDOW_HOURS`: (Optional) How long after creation `editComment` may still rewrite a comment. Defaults to 24. Set to `0` to disable comment editing entirely.
- `CLICKUP_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE`: (Optional) A hint for the primary language used in your ClickUp tasks (e.g., "de" for German, "en" for English). This helps the `searchTask` tool provide more tailored guidance in its description for multilingual searches.
- `LANG`: (Optional) If `CLICKUP_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE` is not set, the MCP will check this standard environment variable (e.g., "en_US.UTF-8", "de_DE") as a fallback to infer the primary language.

### Language-Aware Search Guidance

The `searchTask` tool's description will dynamically adjust based on the detected primary language:
- If `CLICKUP_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE` or `LANG` suggests a known primary language (e.g., German), the tool's description will specifically recommend providing search terms in both English and that detected language (e.g., German) for optimal results.
- If no primary language is detected, a more general recommendation for multilingual workspaces will be provided.

This feature aims to improve search effectiveness when the language of user queries (often English) differs from the language of the tasks in ClickUp, without making the MCP itself perform translations. The responsibility for providing bilingual search terms still lies with the agent calling the MCP, but the MCP offers more specific advice if it has a language hint.

## Markdown Formatting Support

Task descriptions and list documentation support full markdown formatting:

### Examples

**Task Creation with Markdown:**
```
Create a task called "API Integration" with description:
# API Integration Requirements

## Authentication
- Implement OAuth 2.0 flow
- Add JWT token validation
- **Priority**: High security standards

## Endpoints
1. `/api/users` - User management
2. `/api/data` - Data retrieval
3. `/api/webhook` - Event notifications

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for auth flow
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Load testing with 1000+ concurrent users

> **Note**: This replaces the legacy REST implementation

See related task: https://app.clickup.com/t/abc123
```

**Append-Only Updates (Safe):**
When updating task descriptions, content is safely appended:
```markdown
[Existing task description content]

---
**Edit (2024-01-15):** Added new acceptance criteria based on client feedback:
- Must support mobile responsive design
- Performance requirement: < 2s load time
```

This ensures no existing content is ever lost while maintaining a clear audit trail.

## Writing Images Into Tickets

`addComment`, `editComment`, `createTask` and `updateTask` accept images as ordinary markdown. Because
this server runs locally, it reads the file itself - so a **local path is enough**:

```markdown
Ist umgesetzt. So sieht es aus:

**1. Login öffnen** – der Kunde gibt nur seine E-Mail-Adresse ein.

![Die Login-Maske fragt nur nach der E-Mail](/Users/me/shots/login.png)
```

Accepted sources: local file paths, `data:` URIs, http(s) URLs (downloaded, then
re-uploaded), and existing ClickUp attachment URLs (embedded without re-uploading).

Notes:

- **Prefer paths over base64.** A path costs a few tokens; the same screenshot as a
  `data:` URI costs roughly 4/3 of its file size in the request.
- **The caption becomes the attachment filename**, and that filename is what ClickUp
  displays beneath the image - so write a caption that reads well.
- **An image inside a numbered list breaks ClickUp's numbering.** Write walkthrough
  steps as bold lines with the image between them, as above.
- Only real PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP files are uploaded - the content is checked, not the
  extension. A file that fails **aborts the write**: `addComment`, `editComment` and
  `updateTask` report every broken reference and change nothing, so the markdown can be
  fixed and the call retried without creating duplicates. `createTask` validates its
  images before creating the task; only an upload failing afterwards is reported as a
  warning, since the task already exists at that point.
- Attachments always belong to a task, so document pages cannot embed uploads this way.

## Performance & Limitations

**Optimized for AI Workflows:**
- **Smart Image Processing**: Intelligent size budgeting prioritizes the most recent images while respecting both count (`MAX_IMAGES`, default: 4) and total response size limits (`MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_MB`, default: 1MB)
- **Search Scope**: Searches within the most recent 1000-3000 tasks to prevent running into rate limits (exact number varies by endpoint)
- **Search Results**: Returns up to 50 most relevant matches to prevent flooding the agent with too many results

**Current Scope:**
- Focused on task-level operations rather than bulk workspace management
- Optimized for conversational AI workflows rather than data migration
- Designed for productivity enhancement, not administrative operations

These limitations ensure reliable performance while covering the most common use cases for both development context and productivity management.
